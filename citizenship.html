    <h1>Citizenship</h1>
    <h2>This is what citizenship means to me</h2>
    <a href="contract.html"> Look at my Contract!</a>
    <p>I do believe that honest, compassion, respect, responsibility, and courage are necessare components of good citizenship.</p>
    <p>*Citizenship: behaving in a way that respects you and the people around you.  Also following the rules or laws in given place.</p>
    <p>*Honesty: being truthful to yourself and others, holding yourself accountable for actions.</p>
    <p>*Compassion: having pride and love for what you are representing or what you are doing.</p>
    <p>*Respect: caring or admiring a certain person or object for their accomplishments or actions.</p>
    <p>*Responsibility: having control over certain actions and being held accountable for said actions.</p>
    <p>*Courage: being brave, taking control and doing something that scares many who are not willing to take a risk.</p>
    <p>*Good Morals: knowing what is right vs. wrong and knowing how to fix your mistakes. This ties back into responsibilities.</p>
    <p>An example of citizenship in my life:<p/>
    <p>Most recient act of powerful citizenship that I have witnessed was today in class, I was having trouble with making this website and Ally helped me with codes and colors because she understands better than I do.</p>
